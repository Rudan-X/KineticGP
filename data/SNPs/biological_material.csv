Should be unique within the Investigation. Can correspond to experimental plant ID, seed lot ID, etc… This material identification is different from a BiosampleID which corresponds to Observation Unit or Samples sections below.","Either a registered or other designation given to the material received, other than the donor’s accession number or collecting number. First letter uppercase. Multiple names are separated by a semicolon without space.","Genus name for the organism under study, according to standard scientific nomenclature.","Species name (formally: specific epithet) for the organism under study, according to standard scientific nomenclature.","Name of any subtaxa level, including variety, crossing name, etc. It can be used to store any additional taxonomic identifier. Either free text description or key-value pair list format (the key is the name of the rank and the value is the value of  the rank). Ranks can be among the following terms: subspecies, cultivar, variety, subvariety, convariety, group, subgroup, hybrid, line, form, subform. For MCPD compliance, the following abbreviations are allowed: ‘subsp.’ (subspecies); ‘convar.’ (convariety); ‘var.’ (variety); ‘f.’ (form); ‘Group’ (cultivar group).","Description of any process or treatment applied uniformly to the biological material, prior to the study itself. Can be provided as free text or as an accession number from a suitable controlled vocabulary.","Institute code, that maintains the observed accession",Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the material source,Latitude of the material source.
